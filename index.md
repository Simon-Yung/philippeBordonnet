        # PHILIPPE BORDONNET  

        Inspired, **Philippe Bordonnet** appears to impose colors and movements to wash over him free of restraints, with the energy of life and the occasionally extravagant daze of spontaneous emotions !  
        &nbsp;  
        **HIS EXPRESSION REMAINS THAT OF A FIGURATIVE ABSTRACTION**  
        &nbsp;  
        The truths he expresses seem to frame his "gestures" and offer a contemporary poetry that permits us some jubilant lapses.  
        &nbsp;  
        This man loves life, and knows to explore and understand it. No doubt therein lie his inspirations, his fulgurances.
        Nature, people, their attidudes... It is thus, without restraint, that he reaches out to his destination and presents us with an " introductory scene" which for us, the viewers, will be a formidable and evident journey of emotions and excitements....
